Incorporate features into an app by utilizing class-based and generic views.
By examining the commented-out function-based views and comparing them to the built-in generic views, 
observe how class-based views streamline the development process by abstracting common tasks in super classes.
This abstraction helps reduce the workload and simplifies the implementation of app features.
